                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Sites for Success was founded on a simple but powerful idea: no nonprofit should be held back by technology or budget barriers. We saw countless small, impactful organizations struggling to be seen and heard in a digital world because professional web services were out of reach. We decided to close that gap by providing high-quality starter websites, completely free of charge.</p>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>We envision a world where every organization, regardless of its size or resources, can share its mission, attract supporters, and grow its impact online. We believe in technology as a force for good, creating an on-ramp for grassroots initiatives to connect, inspire, and build better communities.</p>

                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equity Focus:</strong> We prioritize under-resourced organizations that are typically left behind by costly web agencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Hidden Costs:</strong> By using free platforms like GitHub Pages, we ensure there are no hosting fees or surprise bills for you or for us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable Model:</strong> Our clear, repeatable package allows us to help more nonprofits effectively and efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>A Stepping Stone:</strong> We provide the perfect foundation. As you grow, you can "graduate" to more advanced features and platforms.</li>
